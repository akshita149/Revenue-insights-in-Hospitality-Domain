AtliQ Grands - Business and Data Intelligence Dashboard

AtliQ Grands is a luxury hotel chain with multiple five-star properties across India. Having been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years, the brand has faced recent challenges due to increasing competition and ineffective decision-making. This has resulted in a decline in market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category.

To regain their position in the market, the managing director has decided to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” into the company’s strategic operations. However, due to the absence of an in-house data analytics team, AtliQ Grands' revenue management team opted to partner with a 3rd-party service provider for data-driven insights.

Project Overview


As part of this initiative, I, as a data analyst, have been tasked with:

-Creating Metrics: Developing key metrics based on the business requirements outlined by stakeholders.

-Dashboard Development: Designing a user-friendly dashboard to visualize critical KPIs and provide actionable insights. The dashboard follows a mock-up provided by the stakeholders to align with the business objectives.

-Generating Additional Insights: Beyond the pre-defined metrics, I will explore the data to identify relevant trends, patterns, and anomalies that can further assist in strategic decision-making.

Key Objectives


-Provide detailed metrics that reflect the performance of AtliQ Grands' properties.

-Visualize the data in a way that makes it easy for stakeholders to interpret and act upon.

-Highlight opportunities for revenue growth, market share recovery, and operational improvements.

Deliverables


-Metrics: A comprehensive list of calculated metrics based on historical data.

-Interactive Dashboard: A fully functional dashboard that showcases the key metrics and insights.

-Additional Insights: Extra data-driven findings not included in the initial mock-up.

This project aims to provide AtliQ Grands with actionable intelligence to regain their market position and make better data-driven decisions in the highly competitive luxury hotel industry.
